    <h1>The GlitchPitch Story</h1>
    <div class="story-text">
      <p>GlitchPitch was born from the fusion of precision and creativity — where the discipline of sports meets the art of design.</p>
      <p>Every curve of a baseball seam, every swing of a bat, and every pixel of light represents a commitment to flawless execution. We don’t chase perfection — we <em>engineer</em> it.</p>
      <p>The glitch isn’t an error. It’s our signature — a reminder that innovation often starts where the system breaks.</p>
      <p>From the field to the screen, GlitchPitch stands for bold energy, futuristic aesthetics, and the confidence to play beyond limits.</p>
      <p><strong>Precision in Every Pixel.</strong></p>
