    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        GlitchPitch started with a simple idea: blend digital chaos with real-world precision.
        What began as a passion for glitch art and sports culture evolved into a brand built
        around bold visuals, neon energy, and clean athletic design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every product carries our signature mix — 75% sporty, 25% glitchy — powered by
        neon green (#39FF14) and neon pink (#FF00C8).
    </p>
    <p>
        This is only the beginning. Welcome to the future of digital-sport style.
